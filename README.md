# OpenWeatherMapApi-Application
This program was developed in C# using Visual studio and utilizes Open WeatherMapApi. 
The program gathers weather data from capitals all over Europe and saves it to a local database. Once data is saved to the database, you can access todays weather and filter/lookup saved weather data. 


I have included WeatherDatabasescript.sql so that you can replicate the database.
